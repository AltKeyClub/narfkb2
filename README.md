## Attention

I'm a hobbyist/amateur at best. So there may be things that aren't optimized. That being said I've had the files
in the `gerbers/` directory manufactured at JLC with 1.6mm size and they work just fine with my fork of the qmk repository
directory. So if you decide to use this, then please be advised that I'm not providing any sort of liability and you should
exercise some caution.

You can just copy the code over to your own repository.
